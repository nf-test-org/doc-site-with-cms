## Automated Builds

Because JAMstack markup is prebuilt, content changes wonâ€™t go live until you run another build. Automating this process will save you lots of headache. You can do this yourself with webhooks, or use a publishing platform that includes the service automatically.

## Atomic Deploys

As JAMstack projects grow really large, new changes might require re-deploying hundreds of files. Uploading these one at a time can cause inconsistent state while the process completes. You can avoid this with a system that lets you do "atomic deploys," where no changes go live until all changed files have been uploaded.

## Instant Cache Invalidation

When the build-to-deploy cycle becomes a regular occurrence, you need to know that when a deploy goes live, it really goes live. Eliminate any doubt by making sure your CDN can handle instant cache purges.
